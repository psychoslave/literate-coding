# About literate-coding

This repository is intended to share documentation, good practices, tools and more regarding literate coding.

Note: literate coding is different from [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). This are two different practices that might be used independently or in combination.

# Manifesto
Note: this is a work in progress.

Much programming code use many unhabitual vocabulary as part of their prose. Literate coding intend to reduce the use of logogram, ideograms, abbreviations, and so on as much as possible in each existing programming language solely using their included facilites.

# Why
TODO: develop "reading happen more often", "how human read", "searchability"

# Examples
